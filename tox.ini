# We list the warnings/errors to check for here rather than in setup.cfg because
# we don't want these options to apply whenever anyone calls flake8 from the
# command-line or their code editor - in this case all warnings/errors should be
# checked for. The warnings/errors we check for here are:
# E101 - mix of tabs and spaces
# W191 - use of tabs
# W291 - trailing whitespace
# W292 - no newline at end of file
# W293 - trailing whitespace
# W391 - blank line at end of file
# E111 - 4 spaces per indentation level
# E112 - 4 spaces per indentation level
# E113 - 4 spaces per indentation level
# E301 - expected 1 blank line, found 0
# E302 - expected 2 blank lines, found 0
# E303 - too many blank lines (3)
# E304 - blank lines found after function decorator
# E305 - expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition
# E306 - expected 1 blank line before a nested definition
# E502 - the backslash is redundant between brackets
# E722 - do not use bare except
# E901 - SyntaxError or IndentationError
# E902 - IOError
# E999: SyntaxError -- failed to compile a file into an Abstract Syntax Tree
