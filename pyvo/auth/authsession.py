    A requests-like session that pyvo can use to dispatch its

    The user adds their credentials to the credentials object,

    The network requests made by pyvo pass through here, and
    the URL of the request is matched against the capabilities
    of the service.  Based on what credentials have been
    provided and the capabilities of the service, appropriate
    credentials are added to the request before it is sent.
