"""
A module for searching for images in a remote archive.

A Simple Image Access (SIA) service allows a client to search for
images in an archive whose field of view overlaps with a given
rectangular region on the sky.  The service responds to a search query
with a table in which each row represents an image that is available
for download.  The columns provide metadata describing each image and
one column in particular provides the image's download URL (also
called the *access reference*, or *acref*).  Some SIA services act as
a cut-out service; in this case, the query result is a table of images
whose field of view matches the requested region and which will be
created when accessed via the download URL.

This module provides an interface for accessing an SIA service.  It is
implemented as a specialization of the DAL Query interface.

The ``search()`` function support the simplest and most common types
of queries, returning an SIAResults instance as its results which
represents the matching images from the archive.  The SIAResults
supports access to and iterations over the individual records; these
are provided as SIARecord instances, which give easy access to key
metadata in the response, such as the position of the image's center,
the image format, the size and shape of the image, and its download
URL.

The ``SIAService`` class can represent a specific service available at a URL
endpoint.

    The list of matching images resulting from an image (SIA) query.
    Each record contains a set of metadata that describes an available
    image matching the query constraints.  The number of records in
    the results is available by passing it to the Python built-in ``len()`` function.

    This class supports iterable semantics; thus,
    individual records (in the form of
    :py:class:`~pyvo.dal.sia.SIARecord` instances) are typically
    accessed by iterating over an ``SIAResults`` instance.

    Alternatively, records can be accessed randomly via
    :py:meth:`getrecord` or through a Python Database API (v2)
    Cursor (via :py:meth:`~pyvo.dal.query.DALResults.cursor`).
    Column-based data access is possible via the
    :py:meth:`~pyvo.dal.query.DALResults.getcolumn` method.

    ``SIAResults`` is essentially a wrapper around an Astropy
    :py:mod:`~astropy.io.votable`
    :py:class:`~astropy.io.votable.tree.Table` instance where the
    columns contain the various metadata describing the images.
    One can access that VOTable directly via the
    :py:attr:`~pyvo.dal.query.DALResults.votable` attribute.  Thus,
    when one retrieves a whole column via
    :py:meth:`~pyvo.dal.query.DALResults.getcolumn`, the result is
    a Numpy array.  Alternatively, one can manipulate the results
    as an Astropy :py:class:`~astropy.table.table.Table` via the
    following conversion:

    ``table = results.votable.to_table()``

    ``SIAResults`` supports the array item operator ``[...]`` in a
    read-only context.  When the argument is numerical, the result
    is an
    :py:class:`~pyvo.dal.sia.SIARecord` instance, representing the
    record at the position given by the numerical index.  If the
    argument is a string, it is interpreted as the name of a column,
    and the data from the column matching that name is returned as
    a Numpy array.
