"""
a module for basic VO Registry interactions.

A VO registry is a database of VO resources--data collections and
services--that are available for VO applications.  Typically, it is
aware of the resources from all over the world.  A registry can find
relevent data collections and services through search
queries--typically, subject-based.  The registry responds with a list
of records describing matching resources.  With a record in hand, the
application can use the information in the record to access the
resource directly.  Most often, the resource is a data service that
can be queried for individual datasets of interest.

This module provides basic, low-level access to the RegTAP Registries using
standardized TAP-based services.

    The function accepts query constraints either as Constraint objects
    passed in as positional arguments or as their associated keywords.
    For what constraints are available, see :ref:`registry-basic-interface`.


    The values of keyword arguments may be tuples or lists when the associated
    Constraint objects take multiple arguments.

    All constraints, whether passed in directly or via keywords, are
    evaluated as a conjunction (i.e., in an AND clause).

    Parameters
    ----------
    *constraints : `~pyvo.registry.Constraint` instances
        The constraints (keywords to match, positions to cover, ...)
        that the returned records need to satisfy.
        The accepted constraints are:

            - keywords: one or more freetext words, mached in the title,
              description or subject of the resource.
            - servicetype: constrain to one of tap, ssa, sia, conesearch
              (or full ivoids for other service types). This is the
              constraint you want to use for service discovery.
            - ucd: constrain by one or more UCD patterns; resources match
              when they serve columns having a matching UCD
              (e.g., phot.mag;em.ir.% for "any infrared magnitude").
            - waveband: one or more terms from the vocabulary at
              http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/messenger giving the rough spectral
              location of the resource.
            - author: an author ("creator"). This is a single SQL pattern,
              and given the sloppy practices in the VO for how to write
              author names, you should probably generously use wildcards.
            - datamodel: one of obscore, epntap, or regtap: only return TAP
              services having tables of this kind.
            - ivoid: exactly match a single IVOA identifier (that is,
              in effect, the primary key in the VO).
            - spatial: match resources covering a certain geometry (point,
              circle, polygon, or MOC). RegTAP 1.2 Extension.
            - spectral: match resources covering a certain part of the spectrum
              (usually, but not limited to, the electromagnetic spectrum).
              RegTAP 1.2 Extension
            - temporal: match resources covering a some point or interval in
              time. RegTAP 1.2 Extension

        Multiple constraints are combined conjunctively ("AND").


    includeaux : bool
        Flag for whether to include auxiliary capabilities in results.
        This may result in duplicate capabilities being returned,
        especially if the servicetype is not specified.

    maxrec : int
        Overrides the RegTAP server's default limit on the number of rows to
        return.  You may need to use this if you want to retrieve more
        than a few thousand matches.  The server may also have a hard limit
        that ``maxrec`` cannot override.  Note that truncated search results
        are not reproducible.

    **kwargs : strings, mostly
        shorthands for ``constraints``; see the documentation of
        a specific constraint for what keyword it uses and what literal
        it expects.
